Verapamil is used for the treatment of high blood pressure, angina (chest pain from not enough blood flow to the heart), and supraventricular tachycardia.

Its major metabolizing enzyme is CYP3A4, but also CY2C8 to some extent ([Tracy 1999](#5-references)). The dose- and time-dependent nonlinear behavior of verapamil is well described through implementation of the synergistic CYP3A4 mechanism-based (auto-)inactivation by verapamil. 

The presented verapamil model was established using observed concentration-time profiles of more than 10 clinical studies with doses from 0.1 mg to 240 mg in different verapamil dosing schedules including multiple doses over up to 10 days and different routes of administration (intravenous, single and multiple oral administration). 

The herein presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of the PBPK model for verapamil in (healthy) adults. 

The established verapamil PBPK model is verified for the use as a perpetrator drug in drug-drug interaction simulations.
