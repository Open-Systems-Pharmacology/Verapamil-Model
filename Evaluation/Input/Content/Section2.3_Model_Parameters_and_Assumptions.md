### 2.3.1 Absorption

Absorption observed in clinical studies can be fully explained by passive absorption.

### 2.3.2 Distribution

After testing the available organ-plasma partition coefficient and cell permeability calculation methods built in PK-Sim, observed clinical data was best described by choosing the partition coefficient calculation by `Rodgers and Rowland` and cellular permeability calculation by `PK-Sim Standard`. 

### 2.3.3 Metabolism, Elimination and Induction

Verapamil is metabolized by CYP3A4  and CYP2C8. 

Mechanism-based inactivation of CYP3A4  was taken into account. KI was taken from literature ([Rowland-Yeo 2011](#5-references)), kinact was optimized.

The first model simulations showed that gut wall metabolization was too low in the PBPK model. In order to increase gut wall metabolization, the “mucosa permeability on basolateral side” (jointly the model parameters in the mucosa: ``P (interstitial->intracellular)`` and ``P (intracellular->interstitial)``) was estimated. This may lead to higher gut wall concentrations and, in turn, to a higher gut wall elimination.

### 2.3.4 Automated Parameter Identification

The parameter identification tool in PK-Sim has been used to estimate selected model parameters by adjusting to PK data of the clinical studies that were used in the model building process. 

The result of the final parameter identification is shown in the table below:

| Model Parameter            | Optimized Value | Unit |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ---- |
| Specific intestinal permeability | 1.6341738226E-05 | cm/min |
| Solubility at reference pH | 43514.8753161441 | mg/l |
| kinact CYP3A4 | 0.0376212371 | 1/min |
| Basolateral mucosa permeability (``P (interstitial->intracellular)``, ``P (intracellular->interstitial)``)| 5.415E-4 | cm/min |
| CYP3A4 - CLspec | 4.6482034823 | l/µmol/min |
| CYP2C8 - CLspec | 0.3179498362 | l/µmol/min |
